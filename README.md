I’m a **Full-Stack Developer & System Builder** focused on building **real-world, scalable software systems** — especially **real-time platforms, backend architectures, authentication systems, and AI-assisted decision engines**.

I believe in **end-to-end ownership**: designing, building, deploying, and *explaining* systems clearly.

## 🧠 How I Think About Software

- **Systems > Scripts**
- **Real-time problems are the hardest (and most fun)**
- **Security & data flow matter**, even in student projects
- **Every project should be demo-able, explainable, and useful**

> *Automation without understanding is fragile. Understanding without execution is useless.*

## 🚀 Featured Projects

## 1️⃣ Real-Time Digital Twin for Railway Logistics (AI-Optimized)

🔗 **Live:** https://railway-simulation-nine.vercel.app/  
💻 **GitHub:** https://github.com/iamanu26/railway-simulation  

### Overview
A **scalable, real-time simulation platform** that creates a **Digital Twin of a railway network**.  
Multiple users interact simultaneously (**Station Master & Loco Pilots**), while an **AI Reinforcement Learning model** analyzes traffic patterns and suggests optimal routing decisions to reduce delays and prevent collisions.

### Architecture (Event-Driven Microservices)
- **Frontend:** Vanilla JavaScript + HTML5 (Vercel)
- **Real-Time Server:** Node.js + Socket.IO (Render)
- **AI Engine:** Python (Flask) + PPO RL model (PyTorch, Stable-Baselines3)

### Key Engineering Highlights
- **Real-Time Sync (<50ms):** WebSockets to sync train positions, signals, and speed across devices
- **Scalability Optimization:** Socket.IO Rooms for targeted updates → **90% bandwidth reduction**
- **AI Decision Support:** RL agent provides actionable insights (e.g., *“Reroute Train 12951 to Loop Line”*)
- **Emergency Handling:** Instant Emergency Stop system halting simulation threads and alerting control center
- **Cloud-Native Deployment:** CI/CD pipeline (GitHub → Vercel / Render)

### Interview Demo Flow
1. Open site on laptop → login as **Station Master (SM101 – NDL)**
2. Open site on phone (mobile data) → login as **Loco Pilot (LP201 – Train 12951)**
3. Trigger **Emergency Stop** → instant alert on laptop
4. Show **AI recommendation** appearing live

## 2️⃣ YouTube Backend System (Node.js)

A **production-style backend** inspired by real video platforms.

### Features
- JWT Authentication (**Access + Refresh Tokens**)
- Secure middleware-based request handling
- Video, subscription, and channel management
- Cloudinary integration for media uploads
- Clean controller-service-model architecture

### What This Demonstrates
- Strong **backend architecture fundamentals**
- Secure **auth flows & token lifecycle management**
- Real-world Express.js project structure
