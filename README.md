I’m a **Full-Stack Developer & System Builder** who enjoys building **real-world, scalable systems** — especially **real-time platforms, backend architectures, authentication systems, and AI-assisted decision engines**.

I focus on **end-to-end ownership**: designing, building, deploying, and clearly explaining systems.
